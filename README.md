**Chapter 1   The Science of Biology**
1) Science is subdivided into specific areas of study termed disciplines. These divisions are artificial but are helpful to narrow the massive scope of scientific knowledge to a manageable amount. Given what you know about each, which scientific division is likely to present the best answer to a question about how fluid dynamics affect blood pressure in mammals?

To answer this question, the student set up two conditions. In the first condition, the student added salt to water in a container and referred to this condition as the variable. In the second condition, the student did not add any salt to water in a second container and referred to this condition as the control. The student took both containers and attempted to freeze the water at various temperatures to assess the freezing point. Would this be a valid experiment?
